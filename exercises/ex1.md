# Addition
Input File: input.addin.txt\
Output File: addout.txt

Your task here is a straight-forward one: you are to write a program that takes two numbers and adds them together.\
Luckily, computers are built for adding numbers together and will do all the calculation for you - all you need to do is write code that will correctly read from and write to the text files.

## Input: addin.txt
The input file will consist of the two integers a and b separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that 0 <= a, b <= 1,000,000,000.

## Output: addout.txt
Your output file should consist of a single integer, the sum of a and b.

## Sample Input
`23 45`

## Sample Output
`68`
